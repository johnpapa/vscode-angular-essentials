I am often asked, "What are you favorite VS Code extensions for Angular?". I decided it was time to share them via an extension pack.

[Angular Language Service](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Angular.ng-template) - This extension provides a rich editing experience for Angular templates, both inline and external templates. This extension is brought to you by members of the Angular team. It is fantastic at helping write solid code in the html templates.

[tslint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eg2.tslint) - Integrates the tslint linter for the TypeScript language into VS Code. Extremely helpful at detecting and helping fix TypeScript issues.

[Path Intellisense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=christian-kohler.path-intellisense) - Visual Studio Code plugin that autocompletes filenames. Hopefully, VS Code will bake this in at some point. Until then, this is a keeper.

[Karma Problem Matcher](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rctay.karma-problem-matcher) Capture errors from Karma tests running in Visual Studio Code, so test failures will show up in 'Problems' pane (Ctrl+Shift+M on Windows/Linux, ⇧⌘M on Mac) and the failing test can also be made known to VS Code, eg. highlighted with squiggly lines, jumping to it with F8.
