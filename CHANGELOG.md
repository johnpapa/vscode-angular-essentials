# 13.0.0 (2022-03-11)

- minor updates for Angular 13 and readme
- removed angular console as its great, but not "needed"
- removed debuggers as they are deprecated

  > These extensions have been deprecated as Visual Studio Code now has a bundled JavaScript Debugger that covers the same functionality. It is a debugger that debugs Node.js, Chrome, Edge, WebView2, VS Code extensions, and more. You can safely un-install this extension and you will still be able to have the functionality you need.
